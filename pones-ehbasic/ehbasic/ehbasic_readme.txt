 Enhanced BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for the 6502 family microprocessors. It
 is constructed to be quick and powerful and easily ported between 6502 systems.
 It requires few resources to run and includes instructions to facilitate easy
 low level handling of hardware devices. It also retains most of the powerful
 high level instructions from similar BASICs.
